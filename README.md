## Project Topic: Amazon Product Review Analysis


##Project Overview

As part of my capstone project at Digital Skill Africa, I carried out a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an Amazon dataset. This project was designed to test my analytical thinking, technical skills, and storytelling ability using data. The case study is centered around Amazon, one of the largest global e-commerce platforms involved in the buying and selling of goods across diverse categories.



##Objectives

The goal of this analysis is to generate actionable insights that can support

• Product improvement • Marketing strategy • Customer engagement



##Tools & Functions Used

• Microsoft Excel

- Text-to-Column
- Data Cleaning Tools
- Pivot Tables
- Calculated Columns
- Logical Function (IF)



##Data Cleaning Process

Before the analysis, I performed data preparation using Excel:

Removed duplicates to ensure accuracy.

Used Text-to-Columns to split detailed information in the category column, retaining only the most relevant part.

Replaced blank cells (especially in rating and rating count) with 0 to avoid analytical errors.

Created pivot tables for analysis.

Used calculated columns to derive additional metrics like discount status, potential revenue, and price buckets.



##Key Business Questions Answered
